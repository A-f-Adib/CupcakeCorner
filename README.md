<h3> Description:</h3> <br>

In this project i built a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes. This is made with a couple of forms and protocols. In this app users can order normal and customized cup cakes from online. They can see how much to pay for each customized cakes. 

<br>
<h3> What I Learned:</h3> <br>
Here i learned how to send and receive the order data from the internet, how to calculate every different type of customized orders, how to validate forms and sections, how to use stepper and much more.
<br>

<br>I also learned about enum and codingkeys. which was used to see the json data more efficiently. For fetching the data from server i used URLsession.

As i continue to dig deeper and deeper into Codable, I found how flexible and safe it is.
